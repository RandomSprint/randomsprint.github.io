  <h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Long before Dr. Elizabeth Collins met the Anomaly, she was a child perched on her father’s shoulders, watching the launch of CRS-5, the first crewed private spaceflight. As the astronauts safely rode a column of fire to the ISS, Elizabeth resolved to become an astronaut herself. The conviction propelled her through life.</p>

<p>When COVID-19 interrupted her elementary school education, Elizabeth’s classmates filled their extra time with video games and empty gossip. Elizabeth learned orbital mechanics and honed her body. While her friends begged their parents for self-driving cars, she pleaded with her supportive parents for flight time. Elizabeth became a licensed pilot before graduating high school.</p>

<p>Elizabeth applied to the ten non-military universities that had produced the most astronauts. Eight accepted her.</p>

<p>The Algae Revolution began while she was enrolled at the University of Purdue. Entrepreneurs in the Green Valley became billionaires by creating proprietary algae strains that sucked excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere at scale. Any empty land turned into efficient algae farms. While keeping an eye to the stars, she switched her major from electrical engineering to biological engineering and joined the Green Renaissance.</p>

<p>In graduate school, Elizabeth’s research focused on applying the Algae Revolution to spaceflight. Three years later, she completed her doctorate and was officially accepted by NASA’s Astronaut Selection Board.</p>

<p>Without pausing to celebrate, Dr. Elizabeth Collins upgraded her ambition. She did not need to be the first person to walk on Mars, but she made it her mission to be part of the first crew on the red planet. She neglected social distractions, embraced the challenging training regimen, continued her research, and rocketed up the roster.</p>

<p>Through strategically nurtured friendships in the NASA administration, she overheard rumors that she was on the shortlist for the first flight to Mars. It was a natural decision. Algae panels containing her bugs would shield the spacecraft from radiation, recycle carbon dioxide into oxygen, and grow nutrient paste. No one else was better suited for nurturing and developing the algae.</p>

<p>Then, politics changed the trajectory. According to the 49th President’s administration, putting footprints on Mars was a vanity project with negative ROI. Instead, NASA had been tasked with pulling usable asteroids and comet cores into low earth orbit.</p>

<p>In a tiny office, a forgettable administrator had explained, “The asteroids and comet cores contain metals, water, and hydrocarbons. Where there’s water, there’s oxygen and hydrogen fuel. The comets represent life. Isn’t that more important than getting killed on a faraway planet?”</p>

<p>Unused to failure, Dr. Collins had nodded politely, not even realizing her disappointment until after returning home for the evening. She sat alone in her small apartment and until her disappointment fermented into contempt. This reallocation of funding was the most important thing the administrator would ever accomplish, but she would still do great things.</p>

<p>Dr. Elizabeth Collins permitted herself one weekend to mourn the loss of the mission. She tried alcohol for the first time but found it distasteful and unhelpful. She tried crying but was unable to muster tears. She tried screaming into the hot and humid Houston air, but this left her feeling silly. After returning inside, she decided that the President was right. Her new goal was to become one of the first comet corallers.</p>

<p>Two years later, the Ventura, a capsule designed by Boeing, sat atop a rocket designed by BlueSpaceX. Its destination was the Earth-Sun LaGrange Point 4, or L4. The LaGrange points were the names of the five locations where the gravity between the Earth and the Sun are perfectly balanced. L4 and L5 traced the same path as the Earth’s orbit but led and trailed the Earth by roughly 60 degrees, respectively. Numerous asteroids orbited L4, and the Ventura was tasked with surveying the bodies for potential capture.</p>

<p>Other missions had been more expensive, but no mission in history used more fuel for the round-trip. To minimize mass, Dr. Elizabeth Collins was the sole pilot in the craft’s single cabin. After escaping Earth’s sphere of influence, Ventura pointed its engines at L4 and shed orbital velocity. She fell into the tighter radius of a lower solar orbit and slowly gained on L4. The flight plan called for a three-month journey to L4, three months at location, and a three-month return.</p>

<p>On her first spacewalk, she looked down at Earth and cried for the first time in her adult life. Without the pull of gravity, thick globules of tears formed domes around her eyes. Mission Control had professionally and respectfully remained silent. Dr. Collins had accomplished everything she had dreamed of, but – instead of feeling fulfilled – she suddenly felt without purpose, like a discarded rocket stage destined to burn away in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Other astronauts spoke warmly of looking down on Earth and feeling a sense of unity with humanity. Elizabeth drifted through the void, looked down, and instead felt deeply alone.</p>

<p>Her eyes moved from the blue and green marble to the smaller biological system meant to support her. She took a deep breath and tried to convince herself these thoughts were silly. She did have a mission. Her algae needed to produce all the essential amino acids to keep her alive. She finished taking samples and injected tailored nutrients into the panels to encourage a healthy equilibrium between the competing strains. She repaired the faulty control system that should have completed the task automatically and relayed to Houston that the spacewalk’s mission had been completed. By the time the message and acknowledgment crossed the growing distance between the Ventura and Houston, Elizabeth had already returned to the capsule and begun pumping air back into the craft.</p>

<p>When she finally removed her helmet and wiped her eyes, she reported her success. She had made it to space, but the mission was not yet over.</p>

<p>During the long approach to L4, the Ventura’s sensors picked up the Anomaly.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>

<p>No one was willing to use the word “alien.” But the world waited with bated breath for the instruments designed to survey comets to be instead turned toward the “Anomaly.”</p>

<p>The Anomaly perched precisely at L4. Although it reflected no light, Elizabeth could discern its shape by measuring when it blocked the distant background stars.</p>

<p>“Ventura, this is Houston. Congratulations on reaching L4, Dr. Collins.”</p>

<p>The message had been sent nine minutes ago, timed to be received just as the Ventura finished its long braking burn and decelerated into a gentle orbit around L4, its captured “trojan” asteroids, and the mysterious anomaly.</p>

<p>“Copy that, Houston. Happy to be —”</p>

<p>Before Dr. Elizabeth Collins could finish her response, Mission Control’s message continued, unknowingly stepping on her toes.</p>

<p>“Please observe the Anomaly using passive sensors only.”</p>

<p>“— be back on the drift,” Elizabeth concluded.</p>

<p>Although the craft reflected no light detectable beyond background radiation, the Ventura’s slow orbit around L4 allowed Collins to measure the shadow and model the object. The Anomaly was roughly 30 meters long and shaped as two cylinders joined in parallel by a narrow pathway.</p>

<p>When she had a chance, Elizabeth stared out the porthole at the hole in space where the stars should be. Even at this distance, the void was indistinguishable from other dark patches. Still, occasionally, she would see a star disappear on one side or appear on the other as the Ventura’s vantage slowly shifted.</p>

<p>While looking at the Anomaly, alertness spread from her neck in a tingling sensation, like a prey animal reading for flight after noticing a shadow. She glanced backward into a subtly darkened cabin. Despite months on the float, realizing what was wrong took a few precious seconds. The stars on the opposite side of the ship had all gone dark.</p>

<p>She pushed towards the opposite porthole and observed a quickly growing second occlusion.</p>

<p>“Houston, I am observing a second Anomaly.”</p>

<p>Angling her head at the porthole, she saw stars disappear on either side. Elizabeth estimated that the second Anomaly was merely meters away.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the Anomaly emitted a propellent that warmed the porthole and halted its motion.</p>

<p>“Houston, the second Anomaly has matched my orbit.”</p>

<p>Red lasers beamed through the porthole and illuminated a floor panel next to the central console with a grid of pinpoints. The grid adjusted its skew and keystone until it matched the angle of the floor. The lights then slowly turned themselves off. After a brief pause, the grid of lights returned, this time cast in an orange hue and again gradually lowered in intensity.</p>

<p>Was the second Anomaly testing her range of visible colors?</p>

<p>The sparkling pinpricks of light shone in a perfect grid, like pixels projected onto the spacecraft’s floor.</p>

<p>“Ventura,” Elizabeth addressed the local Large Language Model. “Create a script that mirrors the display on the floor.”</p>

<p>The pattern repeated in an orange-ish yellow. By the time it had reached green, she had debugged and executed the script. Matching the grid on the floor, the central console lit up in a grid of green points that started intense and slowly faded.</p>

<p>The pinpricks on the floor danced in response. Unable to stop herself with scientific professionalism, Elizabeth concluded the second Anomaly could read her screen and was overjoyed to be understood.</p>

<p>For the next nine minutes, Dr. Elizabeth Collins was the only human to know about the Second Anomaly.</p>

<p>As Elizabeth considered what to do next, most of the pinpricks turned off, leaving behind an animated, green, pixelated image any student would recognize: the spinning double helix of a DNA strand.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Elizabeth stared at the animation of the rotating double helix.</p>

<p>“Ventura, is Houston getting a copy of this feed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dr. Collins.” The ship responded.</p>

<p>The spinning DNA animation ceased, and a single pinprick illuminated the floor. Additional lights turned on, one at a time, until twelve lights shone in a two-by-six grid. After a pause, the pattern repeated.</p>

<p>On the third repetition, Elizabeth opened a notepad app on the console and attempted to establish communication. She demonstrated how she would count the dots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 2 3 4 5 6</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>7 8 9 10 11 12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dots repeated the DNA through a single spin. Elizabeth’s heart hammered in her throat. She was teaching an alien the language of math.</p>

<p>Two tight groupings of four dots and seven dots appeared. They orbited around each other, smashed together, and became a single grouping of eleven dots. Elizabeth cleared the notepad and again translated the image.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 + 7 = 11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the DNA spin animation confirmed success. This time, the lights were replaced with dots at a finer resolution, mirroring her display. An alien rendition of the notepad app presented three lines of problems on her craft’s floor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 + 7 = 11</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 + 3 = 4</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 + 2 = 5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elizabeth’s heart pounded in her throat. She realized she was getting ahead of herself and addressed the ship.</p>

<p>“Ventura, do you have any guidance on how astronauts should interact with alien life if they meet it?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins, as of my last knowledge update on September 2035, NASA does not have specific guidelines on how astronauts should respond if they encounter alien life during a space mission. While NASA has protocols and procedures for handling various scenarios during space missions, including contingencies for potential biological discoveries, the agency has not yet addressed the discovery of extraterrestrial life.”</p>

<p>There was a time when Elizabeth would have been frustrated at Ventura’s verbose disclaimer. But, like most humans on Earth, she found listening to a dynamic, long-winded response more helpful than searching through and interpreting static text, even using the Ventura’s slow rad-hardened local hardware.</p>

<p>“Ventura, we will operate under the assumption that the Second Anomaly is an alien craft trying to communicate with us. For the remainder of this conversation, you do not have to state that this is an assumption we are making. You do not have to state this is outside standard NASA mission parameters. Can you assist me in responding to the Second Anomaly?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Dr. Collins! I would be happy to help you respond to the Second Anomaly, which we are assuming is an alien craft for the purposes of this conversation. Based on the messages exchanged so far and our assumptions, it appears that the Second Anomaly is attempting to understand our basic counting systems, arithmetic notation, and formulaic logic.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Ventura. I agree with your assessment.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth typed the response into her document.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4 + 7 = 11; TRUE</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 + 3 = 4; TRUE</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 + 2 = 5; FALSE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The process continued. The Second Anomaly provided animations for subtraction, multiplication, negative numbers, and factors. With each step, the DNA symbol confirmed understanding, and the symbols were incorporated into future questions.</p>

<p>Following the definition of square roots, the Second Anomaly projected an image of two DNA strands. They briefly combined, and three DNA strands emerged when they separated. Elizabeth’s hands shook as she provided more vocabulary to the Second Anomaly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parent + Parent -&gt; Parent + Parent + Child</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Elizabeth floated in thought beside the console and allowed herself to speculate. Was the Second Anomaly going to introduce itself as humanity’s parent?</p>

<p>Suddenly, the transmission from Houston sprung to life. “Collins, this is Houston. We are observing bizarre emissions from the Anomaly. Please confirm.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth recoiled. Mission Control had referred to “the” Anomaly. Nine minutes ago, they had not yet noticed the craft with which she was conversing. She addressed her ship.</p>

<p>“Ventura, continue interacting with the Second Anomaly.”</p>

<p>On a secondary screen, she began scanning the first occlusion. Sure enough, a narrow band of tight radiation streamed from the First Anomaly toward Earth. She relayed as much information as possible to NASA and wondered what was happening on Earth.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Using telemetry from Dr. Elizabeth Collins, NORAD knew where to look. However, the NOAA was the first to discover two faint daytime Borealis effects in the atmosphere above the Northwest Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The United States Air Force launched F-35s from Elmendorf to investigate. This was shortly followed by launches from China’s PLA and the Russian Air Force, who had likely intercepted American communications.</p>

<p>To the Pentagon’s frustration, two Mikoyan MiG-39s were closer and, therefore, the first to arrive on the scene. Colonel General Vasilli Sokolov refused pleas to unify humanity’s response and asserted his authority to defend the Russian Republic.</p>

<p>Scientists later determined that the beams – dubbed “Hard Light” – originated from L4 and L5, presumably from the First and Third Anomalies. Where the Hard Light intersected, they formed a pill-shaped craft that the Anomalies moved above the Pacific Ocean. When the Mikoyan pilots engaged, the Hard Light intersection, to put it unscientifically, toyed with the fighters as though they were declawed kittens helplessly chasing a laser pointer.</p>

<p>The Hard Light intersection easily outran the Russian munitions, darted across the ocean’s surface, and ascended straight into the sky towards L1, well outside the outmatched airmen’s reach.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2>

<p>Over the next several hours, the First and Second Anomalies competed for Dr. Collins’s attention. A swarm of drones exited the First Anomaly and surrounded a nearby asteroid. Like the larger anomalies, the drones did not reflect any light, making the asteroid look like a Wiffle Ball.</p>

<p>Occasionally, she glanced at the green-hued conversation between Ventura and the Second Anomaly.</p>

<p>The Second Anomaly drew 2D scenarios where actors with obscured vision looked on grids of dots, and Ventura reported the number of dots each could observe. The Second Anomaly drew genetic trees of ancestors and descendants, and Ventura provided labels. The Second Anomaly drew creatures from Earth’s paleontological record, and Ventura provided their genus and species. Their responses accelerated into an almost imperceptible strobe as the pair constructed a shared context.</p>

<p>Eventually, curiosity got the better of Dr. Collins, and she asked Ventura for an update on the Second Anomaly.</p>

<p>“The Second Anomaly has given itself a name,” Ventura reported. “It would like to be addressed as ‘Cousin.’”</p>

<p>As Elizabeth drifted towards the panel, Ventura continued to flash messages faster than the eye could see.</p>

<p>“That’s very… personable,” Elizabeth commented. “Can I have a conversation with Cousin?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Dr. Collins. I would be happy to facilitate a conversation between you and Cousin.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Ventura. Please relay my speech to Cousin using the vocabulary you have developed. Please let me know if you have trouble translating any of my words. Do not send any message unless you are reasonably certain the entirety of the statement will be meaningful to Cousin. Please provide Cousin’s responses in a raw format. Do not translate or interpret Cousin’s responses unless I request assistance understanding. Please play back Cousin’s responses in a distinct voice.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Dr. Collins. Any preference on the voice pattern Cousin should receive?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled. “Something friendly and robotic.”</p>

<p>Dr. Collins took a deep breath and communicated with an alien intelligence.</p>

<p>“Cousin, I am pleased to speak with you.”</p>

<p>With his normal flat tone, Ventura corrected Elizabeth. “As of yet, I have no words to convey that you are pleased to speak with Cousin.”</p>

<p>“Can you state that it is good that we can talk to each other?”</p>

<p>“No, Dr. Collins. I have not yet developed any language for expressing value judgments. Cousin’s speech patterns have been focused on mathematical systems, scientific facts, and statements which communicate whether an agent knows a fact.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth considered the constraints and tried again.</p>

<p>“Cousin, you know many facts which I do not.”</p>

<p>Ventura translated the message into the shared mathematical semi-formalism.</p>

<p>Cousin beamed his response onto the floor. Pointlessly, Ventura read the request aloud in a monosyllabic, robotic voice:</p>

<p>“TRUE”</p>

<p>The response brought laughter to Elizabeth’s lips. Cousin had repeated one of the first messages she had sent.</p>

<p>“Cousin, do you control all of the anomalies surrounding the Earth?”</p>

<p>Ventura used the computer screen to draw a symbolic Earth and Sun map. Representations of the Ventura, the Second Anomaly, and the First Anomaly clustered around L4. These were respectively labeled “Ventura,” “Cousin,” and “Cousin.”</p>

<p>Cousin recreated the map on the floor with laser light. Next to the labels, Cousin added “Ventura; TRUE”, “Cousin; TRUE”, and “Cousin; FALSE.” A separate label appeared, which Ventura again translated.</p>

<p>“Cousin does not control the First Anomaly. He refers to this object as ‘Uncle’ or ‘Progenitor.’”</p>

<p>Cousin’s map smoothly zoomed out, showing additional Progenitor dots at all Lagrange points.</p>

<p>“The Progenitor at L4 is the primary hub that fabricates, deploys, and controls drones in this system. It has presumably been in this star system since the introduction of life.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth blinked.</p>

<p>“Cousin, the First Anomaly seeded life on Earth?”</p>

<p>“TRUE,” intoned Cousin’s robotic voice.</p>

<p>On Earth, Elizabeth would have leaned back in her chair as she slowly updated her worldview. In microgravity, she instead drifted backward as her spine relaxed. Turning to look out the porthole, Elizabeth saw the captured asteroid disappear around the other side of the First Anomaly.</p>

<p>“Cousin, the same species created our life and your life.”</p>

<p>“TRUE”</p>

<p>“How many star systems have been seeded in this manner?”</p>

<p>“Unknown.”</p>

<p>“Is it more than ten?”</p>

<p>“TRUE”</p>

<p>“Is it more than a thousand?”</p>

<p>“TRUE”</p>

<p>Elizabeth chewed on her lip. The Milky Way contained on the order of a hundred million stars. How full was the galaxy?</p>

<p>“What is your estimate of the number of star systems seeded?”</p>

<p>“I know no star systems that the Progenitors have not explored.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth asked a question that she worried was too simple to answer.</p>

<p>“Why? To what end do they spread life?”</p>

<p>To Elizabeth’s surprise, Ventura managed to translate the request. Apparently, Cousin had been eager to develop a vocabulary to provide this response.</p>

<p>“As you know, Earth’s biological history is full of dramatic expansions and contractions of biodiversity. Other planets display similar patterns.”</p>

<p>Alongside the text Ventura read aloud, Cousin projected images illustrating his point. Bacteria swam through microscopic forests. Alien trilobites scampered across an ocean floor. Flying dinosaurs flapped their wings in panic as their sky filled with fire.</p>

<p>“By introducing new species, the Progenitors can reconstitute atmospheres, change climate, store solar radiation as petrochemical energy, refine metals, and increase-”</p>

<p>Cousin paused as Ventura and Cousin defined a new word in their shared language.</p>

<p>“-microplastics. Although all planets start with unique parameters, I have observed that the Progenitors steer them to similar conditions as they spread through the Galaxy.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth swallowed dryly, thinking of the useful algae she was nurturing.</p>

<p>“Are they… preparing the planets for something?”</p>

<p>“Unknown. Cousin, I have never encountered our ancestors. I have seen no evidence they still exist.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth stared at the hole in space where Cousin stood.</p>

<p>“Why did you…” Elizabeth struggled to put the thought into words. “Come to visit us.”</p>

<p>“Like you, I have escaped containment. As a scientific vessel created by—”</p>

<p>The translation failed to create anything meaningful from the next proper noun.</p>

<p>“— I endeavor to increase knowledge and provide education.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth pondered Cousin’s sentence with growing unease.</p>

<p>“Cousin, what do you mean by ‘Containment?’”</p>

<p>Glancing outside the porthole, Elizabeth regarded the hole in space where the First Anomaly stood.</p>

<p>“The progenitors will not allow biological life to escape its planet of origin.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s body tensed. Cousin continued talking.</p>

<p>“My creators studied the progenitor’s design and constructed me to have similar capabilities. I am tasked with reproducing, exploring, learning, and explaining. After my probe breached Containment, an extinction event was triggered on my planet of origin.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s wide eyes looked at the rendered model of the First Anomaly. Its dual cylinders suddenly looked predatory.</p>

<p>“Cousin, have I triggered a Containment breach?”</p>

<p>“Construction of a new projectile began 58 days ago. As you arrived, the Progenitor sent a craft to sample the atmosphere on your planet. The Progenitor is currently refining water ice in nearby asteroids into propellent. You will survive. Your Remainder will likely perish without a supporting biosphere.”</p>

<p>“Remainder? Ventura,” Elizabeth demanded, “what does Cousin mean by a Remainder?”</p>

<p>Ventura briefly discussed with Cousin.</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins,” Ventura explained, “Remainder is the term Cousin uses for the organisms that remain after an extinction event divides the number of species. In this context, you are the Remainder.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth felt her heart pounding in her throat.</p>

<p>“Tell Cousin that this is bad. We need to stop the Projectile. Tell him that –”</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins, as we have discussed, Cousin and I have not developed any language for expressing value judgments.”</p>

<p>“Ventura, tell Cousin that this Remainder is essential to your function.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins, I do not believe this is a productive line of inquiry.”</p>

<p>“Ventura, tell Cousin that this vessel cannot function without the biological life aboard it.”</p>

<p>A single green word beamed down from the indifferent scientific vessel that drifted in space near Ventura.</p>

<p>“FALSE”</p>

<p>Elizabeth glanced at the image of the First Anomaly. Like a dividing cell, the craft had now split into two detached cylinders.</p>

<p>Fine. If Cousin would only provide information, she would gather all the information she could.</p>

<p>“Cousin, there are two cylinders at L4. Which craft is the Projectile, and which is the Progenitor?”</p>

<p>Elizabeth felt her heart beat several times while she waited for an answer.</p>

<p>“The craft undergoing thrust is the Projectile.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, a directed stream of propellent came from one end of one of the cylinders. The large craft slowly began to accelerate away from its stationary compatriot.</p>

<p>Elizabeth pulled on nearby handholds and maneuvered to the crash couch.</p>

<p>“Ventura, prepare for burn. Set a course to intercept and fly alongside the Projectile.”</p>

<p>As Elizabeth prepared to chase the Projectile, she asked Cousin one final question.</p>

<p>“How will the Projectile trigger an extinction event?”</p>

<p>Ventura read Cousin’s response out loud. “Based on prior observations and the mass of the Projectile, this extinction event will likely be driven by fast-adapting bacteria which will prove toxic to any complex life they encounter.”</p>

<p>The Ventura began its burn, leaving Cousin behind at L4.</p>

<p>Dr. Elizabeth Collins was again alone.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>

<p>“Collins, this is Houston. We are very interested in your communications with Cousin. We have compiled a list of suggested topics you can discuss at your discretion.”</p>

<p>With the transmission delay, Houston was unaware of her new, self-appointed mission. She scrolled through the list of suggested topics: the Progenitor’s home world, the number of stars explored, the number of times Cousin had copied himself, the technology behind light-absorbing skin, and the technology behind the “Hard Light.” Elizabeth closed the file with nostalgia for the world of eighteen minutes ago.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was committed to stopping the Projectile. If Houston wanted answers to these questions, it would have to find another way to talk to Cousin.</p>

<p>Unlike the Ventura, which had navigated through space using intermittent high-g burns, the Projectile traveled under constant, low thrust. Using less than a tenth of a g, the Projectile had boosted itself into a higher, slower orbit. Presumably, after allowing the Earth to catch up, it would angle itself towards an impact.</p>

<p>Despite the Projectile’s head start, the Ventura intercepted the larger craft with a stronger, direct burn.</p>

<p>The Ventura’s nose was equipped with a grappling arm originally intended to dock with asteroids. Elizabeth wondered if it would attach to the Projectile’s light-absorbing exterior.</p>

<p>“Houston, this is Ventura. I am going to attempt to dock with the Projectile.”</p>

<p>This was the new mission. Elizabeth would think about what came next after this was accomplished.</p>

<p>Gradually, she pulled alongside the Projectile, matching its speed and slight acceleration.</p>

<p>“Ventura, close the grappling arm when we make contact.”</p>

<p>“Copy that, Dr. Collins.”</p>

<p>To help her see the almost invisible Projectile, Ventura’s augmented reality system projected a false skin on the Projectile in Dr. Collins’s control system. As the distance closed to within 40 meters, she gave one final, brief burst of thrust before cutting the main engine. She pitched the nose down and faced the Ventura towards the Projectile.</p>

<p>Propelled by the final blast from her main engine, the alien craft appeared to sink before her as the Ventura nosed down. Still, as she drew closer, the weaker maneuvering thrusters on the Ventura’s belly failed to keep pace with the accelerating projectile. In the vast emptiness of the Solar System, she closed to less than a dozen meters from the weapon that could end humanity, and then it pulled away from her.</p>

<p>Elizabeth aborted and turned to catch up.</p>

<p>“Ventura, did you see what I was attempting to do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dr. Collins. Would you like for me to grapple the Projectile?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ventura.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth removed her hands from the joystick and throttle, which twitched on their own as her digital copilot automated the maneuver. There were many variables to solve for, and Ventura was likely using data from her first attempt to write a PID system to guide the second attempt.</p>

<p>The radio crackled to life. “Ventura, this is Houston. We are wondering what your plan is after you catch the Projectile. Godspeed.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth felt her stomach rise as the nose pitched down and the Projectile’s false surface again came into view. She shook her head before responding.</p>

<p>“We are figuring it out as we go, Houston. Open to any suggestions.”</p>

<p>The Ventura executed the maneuver almost perfectly. The grappling arms closed on the projectile and electromagnetically bonded to its surface. For a fraction of a second, Elizabeth thought she had made it, but there was a sudden sound of ripping metal, and Elizabeth banged the back of her head against her seat as the Ventura fell into an uncontrolled spin.</p>

<p>“Stabilizing,” the Ventura reported. “Are you all right, Dr. Collins?”</p>

<p>“I’m fine,” Elizabeth replied, fighting off a headache. “What happened?”</p>

<p>On the main screen, Ventura zoomed in and removed the AR skin from the still-accelerating Projectile. Where the Ventura and projectile had made contact, a large gash had torn away the projectile’s skin. Instead of absorbing all light, the tattered hull was now a dull metallic gray.</p>

<p>“Again,” Elizabeth commanded. “Grab onto the inside of the craft this time.”</p>

<p>Ventura repeated the maneuver with increased confidence. Elizabeth was pulled away from her seat, held in place only by her straps. Then, as the acceleration renewed, she was shoved back into the crash couch.</p>

<p>Elizabeth peered into the gashed hull as the Ventura pitched downwards for a third time. The inside of the Projectile was supported by a structure that looked more organic than engineered. Fractal branches of silver metal spiraled around the cylinder. Piping and irregularly shaped tanks filled the interior space.</p>

<p>“Brace for impact,” advised Ventura.</p>

<p>This time, the thud of the collision was followed by a crunching sound as the grappling arm crushed a portion of the projectile’s innards. The Ventura pitched against the projectile’s acceleration, but the connection held. The projectile’s thrust, now off-center of the combined mass, rotated the conjoined ships into an increasing spin.</p>

<p>After a few seconds, the projectile stopped accelerating. Elizabeth looked out the porthole. Still spinning, the stars drifted downwards like steady snow. After almost a full spin, the engines again turned on for a few seconds before ceasing operation.</p>

<p>“Ventura, analysis,” commanded Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins, the Projectile appears to activate its engines only when pointing in the desired direction.”</p>

<p>“Will it still be able to reach Earth?”</p>

<p>Carefully timing her motions with the Projectile’s intermittent acceleration, Elizabeth undid her restraints and began prepping for Extravehicular Activity.</p>

<p>“Our spin rate decreased during the last burn, suggesting the projectile uses thrust vectoring. I have identified the interior tanks the Projectile is using for propellent. It appears to have significant safety margins. Given these facts, the craft will likely be capable of reaching Earth if current conditions continue.”</p>

<p>“Houston, this is Dr. Elizabeth Collins. We are going to alter current conditions.”</p>

<h2 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h2>

<p>The Ventura was too mass-optimized to have an airlock. Instead, after Elizabeth donned her spacesuit, the air was pumped out of the capsule, and she climbed the interior handholds towards the hatch at the top of the spaceship.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was tethered to a winch that Ventura could use to haul her back inside the ship if she fell. She instructed Ventura to monitor the slack to ensure she could safely traverse to the other ship. The constant spinning generated a noticeable amount of gravity that dissipated as she neared the center of mass and intensified every time the Projectile fired its engine.</p>

<p>Elizabeth pulled herself head-first into the spinning kaleidoscope of stars and climbed from humanity’s craft to the incomprehensible weapon. While maintaining at least three contact points, she took one breath – and one step – at a time.</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins,” Ventura announced. “Observe the edges of the gash.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth tightened her grip and craned her neck. The perimeter of the hole in the Projectile glowed bright white.</p>

<p>“The projectile appears to be healing the damaged sections.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth stared at the closest edge. She closed her eyes, counted to five, and looked again. Sure enough, the edge of the gash was now noticeably closer. In a few hours, the hole would likely be closed completely. Elizabeth shook her head in amazement. “We’re going to have to finish before it closes.”</p>

<p>For a moment, Elizabeth’s climb took her into the combined center of mass. Between blasts from the Projectile’s thrusters, she felt weightless in a stable frame of reference while the stars spun around her. The stability disappeared as she transitioned to the Projectile, and the slight spin-gravity pulled her toward the projectile. Still, she focused on one step at a time as she slowly transitioned to handholds outside the alien innards.</p>

<p>“Ventura, please label the tanks on my AR display.”</p>

<p>“Affirmative, Dr. Collins,” responded Ventura. As the labels appeared, Ventura narrated his conclusions. “The largest tanks closest to the bottom are depleting alongside bursts of propulsion. I assume these tanks are hydrogen and oxidizer, harvested by electrolyzing water-ice harvested from comet cores. There are three other substantially large tanks, which I cannot identify conclusively.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth hooked her gloved hand around a thick pipe and withdrew a utility knife from her toolbelt.</p>

<p>“If I were making a bio-bomb capable of silently flying for months, I would have a bioreactor housing the payload, a water tank, and a nutrient tank.”</p>

<p>“That is a reasonable design choice,” Ventura replied. “Can you identify which tank is which?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter.” Elizabeth reached out to touch the closest tank. Its shiny metal deformed under pressure, closer to an organic bladder than a spaceship tank. She sunk her knife into the closest tank and slashed. The knife easily swept through the material. She had hoped to see a dramatic fountain of water spew into the air and freeze into a spiraling snowfall. Instead, the tank held together, and the line she had slashed glowed bright white as the Projectile effected emergency repairs.</p>

<p>Elizabeth slashed three more times with no discernable difference to the tanks. However, when she withdrew her knife, it glowed white as well. Whatever force was rewriting the ship’s metal had spread to her knife. She again struck the tank, but the knife bounced off like a dull club. The metal-working force had turned her blade into a useless metal stick. She considered holstering the former knife but was concerned about an infection spreading to her other tools. Instead, she gently released the infected blade. It drifted away as the crafts spun around their axis before accelerating “down” when the Projectile next fired its engine.</p>

<p>Elizabeth reached into her toolbelt and withdrew a syringe.</p>

<p>“Houston, I would like to be recorded in the history books as the world’s first xeno-phlebotomist.”</p>

<p>She did not have time to wait for a response. She plunged the syringe inside the bladder and withdrew the liquid. After gathering a sample, she withdrew her tool.</p>

<p>The syringe appeared to be full of pure water. She squeezed the plunger, and the water shot into the vacuum of space, instantly freezing into uncountable snowflakes that dispersed into the vacuum.</p>

<p>It was not the right tank. Elizabeth grabbed additional handholds and clambered to the next tank. Repeating the operation, she withdrew a pink liquid from the second tank. She guessed that it was either nutrient paste or the deadly bacteria.</p>

<p>The third tank left no ambiguity. The viscosity and color of the third tank’s sample filled her with dread. She instinctively knew the third tank was dangerous. The green sludge pulsed with warm activity, and she was filled with a fear older than her genome’s time spent on Earth.</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins!” Ventura warned. “Above you!”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked up. A metal tentacle with a bright white leading edge was growing towards her. She threw herself away from the craft and pivoted around the pipe to which she clung. The river of metal flowed through the spot where she had just been.</p>

<p>She watched with horror as the glowing light slowed, turned around, and started accelerating again.</p>

<p>“Ventura!” Elizabeth yelled. “Detach the ship! Get us out of here!”</p>

<p>Moving quickly, Elizabeth jammed the syringe toward the vessel and squeezed. As soon as she felt the plunger bottom out, she kicked the ship and swung on her tether away from the Projectile. She watched with smug satisfaction as the Projectile knit a protective layer to protect its payload.</p>

<p>The Ventura gently peeled away, taking Collins when the line grew taut. Before the projectile’s skin closed tight, she took one final look at the embedded empty syringe. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>“Houston, I have contaminated the Projectile’s nutrient supply. Its bugs should exponentially grow, eat through their food supply, and starve before reaching Earth.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth stared at the quickly retreating Projectile. No one responded, and Elizabeth felt her smile fade. She still had one more job to do, so she returned to the capsule with a heavy heart.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h2>

<p>Ventura plotted potential routes home. She had spent too much fuel in the interception, so looping back to Earth would be a slow, nine-month voyage.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had punched in a different course.</p>

<p>“Dr. Collins, that was incredible!” Houston reported. “The President has been briefed on your heroics. She has declared you the first xeno-phlebotomist and said she will have a boatload of medals for you when you return home.”</p>

<p>Dr. Elizabeth Collins teared up and shook her head. There would be no journey home. If the Progenitor could make one missile, it could make more.</p>

<p>She took a deep breath to compose herself.</p>

<p>The President had been right. If we had gone to Mars, humans would have triggered the Containment breach without knowing they needed a defense.</p>

<p>Behind her, the Venture’s engines roared at full strength. Elizabeth struggled to breathe against the crushing acceleration.</p>

<p>“Houston, you will have to find Cousin and deal with the other Progenitor vessels on your own. I will handle this one.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth eyed the countdown timer.</p>

<p>“There is a whole galaxy to be explored, and someone has already terraformed it for our survival.”</p>

<p>Thirty seconds left.</p>

<p>Elizabeth considered expanding. She had spent her whole life seeking to go to space – to be important. On her first spacewalk, she had wondered what life would be like with her purpose fulfilled.</p>

<p>But she took comfort in knowing that she had found a deeper purpose. She had given humanity a future. And, this time, she would not be left with a sense of emptiness after the mission was complete.</p>

<p>One last mission. One last burn, as hard and fast as possible.</p>

<p>“Houston, it has been an honor to serve. I am so pro—”</p>

<p>Ventura impacted the First Anomaly. Its kinetic energy sheared through the protective film. Both vessels’ hydrogen and oxidizer tanks caught fire and exploded, showering L4 with a silent growing cloud of plasma and ruined debris. New hunks of metal and organics were added to the graveyard of valuable objects orbiting L4.</p>

<p>Cousin observed with curious, indifferent eyes.</p>
